Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers read, interpret, and understand human language. The goal of NLP is for machines to carry out repetitive and high-volume tasks that would otherwise be completed by humans.

Once a fantasy of science fiction movies, the ability of machines to interpret human language is now at the core of many applications that we use every day â€“ from translation software, chatbots, spam filters, and search engines, to grammar checking software, voice assistants, and social media monitoring tools.
